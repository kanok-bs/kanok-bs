- 👋 Hi, I’m Md Knaok Hossain, I have been working professionally as a software developer since Nov 2018. For last two and more than half years (+2.11), I have been working as the full-stack developer at multiple projects. Interestingly, for last almost three years I have been working with “Vue Js and Laravel” for frontend and backend.
